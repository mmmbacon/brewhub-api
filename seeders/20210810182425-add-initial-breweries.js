We may be small in size, but we are always looking to experiment with new styles and ingredients. Our small operation means we have steered away from the typical brewery model and are selling directly from our taproom. We are starting tiny and growing small. Whether you are looking for a space to gather and enjoy a few brews or are grabbing brews to-go. We hope Shelter will be your rad little community hub in the heart of our city',

Both Ontario natives, they’ve lived and worked in the Territory for a majority of their adult lives. From that inaugural conversation grew plans for a craft brewery that would service the north with quality beer & spirits while keeping jobs and money in the territory. Over a decade later Yukon Brewing, as it is called today, continues to work towards that goal. Employing a dozen or so staff (more in the busy summer months), Yukon Brewing actively supports countless Yukon events and causes each year. Bob and Alan continue as owners and chief operators, growing the company outside the Yukon. The brewery’s 10 packaged beers are available across Alberta and BC with some even finding their way as far east as Quebec and at the Hannover Zoo in Germany.',
